	<h1>About EZ Password Generator</h1>

	<hr />

	<p>This password generator was written in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> using the <a href="https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin">Gin framework</a>. It takes the list of the 5000 most common English words that are three letters or longer and randomly select three to six of them. You can also customize prefix, suffix, and delimiter characters for better security.</p>

	<p>In today's world, password security is becoming more and more essential. Passwords such as "abc123" and "password" simply won't cut it -- they're an invitation for a hacker to compromise your accounts. Unfortunately many misconceptions have been spread regarding password security, such as the guideline that a password <b>must</b> contain a mix of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and punctuation. This leads people to mangle single words with that strategy, resulting in passwords that are hard to remember, but easy to crack. "Which O's were actually zeros? And which E's were actually threes?"</p>

	<p>I was inspired by the below comic from xkcd. It details the method for producing easy to remember, hard to crack passwords.</p>

	<p>The math behind the passwords generated by this site is reassuring. <i>Even if a hacker knows that your password only consists of four of the 5000 most common English words longer than three letters (and has a list of them all), and that they were all lowercase</i>, it would take almost 20 years to crack your password (assuming 1 million guesses per second). By then, you ideally would've changed your passwords many times. If you use prefix, suffix, and delimiter characters and capitalize a word or two, <b>it becomes exponentially harder to crack</b>.</p>

	<p>So click on that button as much as you like. Explore all of the settings and see which combination of words stick. Making a secure password doesn't have to be hard and remembering a secure password doesn't have to be a chore.</p>
